# 🤖 Mohamed Nabil – AI Automation & Intelligent Workflows

Hi! I’m Mohamed, a **Data Analyst & Machine Learning Engineer** who builds smart, real-world automation systems that actually work — not just demos.  
I specialize in turning messy workflows into clean, intelligent pipelines using **n8n** as my core engine, backed by AI, APIs, and solid data logic.

### 1. 🎯 Multi-Agent WhatsApp Orchestrator (n8n Core Project)  
**Platform**: n8n + WhatsApp Business API  
**AI Models**: Google Gemini + Nvidia Nemotron (via OpenRouter)  

This is my flagship project — a **multi-agent AI assistant** that acts like a personal digital team:

- **Parent Agent**: Understands user input (text, voice, image) and routes tasks intelligently.
- **4 Specialized Sub-Agents**:
  - 📧 **Email Agent**: Reads, replies, and manages Gmail (OAuth2 secure).
  - 📅 **Calendar Agent**: Schedules, checks conflicts, and fetches your events.
  - 🔍 **Web Search Agent**: Pulls live news from Hacker News or summarizes Wikipedia.
  - 🐦 **Social Agent**: Writes & posts AI-generated tweets, logs them in Sheets.

✅ Built entirely in **n8n** — no external servers.  
✅ Fully stateful: remembers context across messages.  
✅ Designed for scale: adding new agents takes <15 minutes.

> This project shows I don’t just *use* n8n — I **architect with it**.
